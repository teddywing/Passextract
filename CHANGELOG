CHANGELOG
=========

v0.5.0 (2022-08-20):

Fixes:

    * Add support for GnuPG 2 with Pinentry.

v0.4.0 (2018-03-03):

Additions:

    * `-i` command line flag hides password strings with stars ('*').
    * Changelog
    * Man page

v0.3.0 (2016-11-14):

Additions:

    * On quit, the clipboard is cleared by setting its contents to an empty
      string. This is to help mitigate unintentional pastes of passwords or
      clipboard exploits.

v0.2.0 (2016-08-17):

Additions:

    * `g` mapping to move to the first selection
    * `G` mapping to move to the last selection

v0.1.1 (2016-08-06):

Changes:

    * Fix bug encountered when copying values/passwords containing the string
      ": ". Previously, anything following the first occurrence of that string
      would not be copied to the clipboard.

v0.1.0 (2016-08-06):

Additions:

    * Passextract can now be invoked as a standalone program instead of
      requiring input to be passed to it through STDIN. It will take a file
      argument in exactly the same way as `pass show`. When run in this way, the
      program will call `pass show` with the given argument and display the
      result in the Passextract interactive interface. It is still possible to
      use the program with STDIN.
    * A Bash completion script is added that enables tab completion and
      functions in the same way as `pass show`.
    * A license, README, and demo screencast are added.

v0.0.1 (2016-08-06):
    * First working release. Reads from STDIN and presents lines beginning with
      "e: ", "u: ", and "p: " in a menu for copying to the clipboard.
