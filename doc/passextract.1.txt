passextract(1)
==============

NAME
----
passextract - Copy login details from pass(1)

SYNOPSIS
--------
*passextract* ['OPTIONS'] ['PASS_FILE']

DESCRIPTION
-----------
An extension to the pass(1) password manager. Passextract provides a UI
similar to urlview(2) that enables these additional fields to be copied
to the system clipboard. Three fields are recognised: emails, usernames,
and passwords. They are defined as follows:

	This text is ignored

	e: email@example.com
	u: username
	p: secret-password

In order to be recognised by Passextract, those fields must be prefixed
by “e: ”, “u: ”, or “p: ” as illustrated above.

The passextract(1) command will parse those fields from 'PASS_FILE'. If
'PASS_FILE' is not provided or if it's '-' then the standard input is
used.

OPTIONS
-------
-i::
	Make password strings invisible by replacing them with stars ("*").

-V, --version::
	Print the program version.

INTERACTIVE CONTROL
-------------------
In the interactive UI, the following commands are available:

q / C-c::
    Quit and clear the clipboard
j::
    Move the selection down
k::
    Move the selection up
g::
    Move the selection to the top
G::
    Move the selection to the bottom
ENTER::
    Copy the currently selected line

EXAMPLES
--------
Passextract can be invoked on its own or with the piped output of `pass
show`.

	$ pass show github.com | passextract
	$ passextract github.com

The included Bash completion file provides the same tab completion
options as `pass show`.

SHELL COMPLETION
----------------
Shell completion is provided to complete pass(1) files. To enable Bash
completion, source the included `passextract.bash-completion` file.
